   <h2>Clever Initial Blog Post Title</h2>

   <div class="info">Posted on June  2, 2012</div>
   <br>

   <p>So this is a blog about me. But what about me in particular? Well here’s a fact about me: I’m currently writing this entry to see what it’ll look like on my blog and to stretch out my blog a little bit.</p>
<p>You see, I consider myself a fantastic writer. I really do. I am able to BS with the best of em; I can churn out 5 pages in the blink of an eye. If words were my domain I would certainly not be surjective because the quantity of words I can combine and transform into a coherent sequence of thoughts is uncountably infinite.</p>
<p>Right now I just finished my Theory of Computation final, I’m considering what hosting to use for this blog (nothing over $10/month please, college kid here), and I’m waiting for a good time to make dinner. Carne asada and some left over turkey chili. It’s only 5 oclock right now so I’m not quite ready to eat yet.</p>
<!--TEASEREND-->

<p>I’m probably intending on keeping this post just because I’m having so much fun writing it. What’s this blog about? SOO many things. Number one, programming because that’s what I like to do. In my spare time and for a living. However I realized that I really haven’t been programming much since I got into college. Outside of my classes of course. So really this blog is about getting me back into something that I consider a part of who I am.</p>
<p>When someone asks me to talk about myself in a “get-to-know-you” way, programming is always something right out of my mouth, yet I realized I haven’t done very much just for the fun of it. That’s wrong, and it changes now, and I’m already having fun writing some Clojure in preparation for my internship this summer. Well, they use Java, but I figure I might try to sneek a little bit of Clojure in if I can.</p>
<p>What else is my blog about? Well, I guess, me! This is actually a pretty good post to link to eventually instead of writing an “About Me.” I hate writing and I hate reading those, they’re so necessarily self-serving.</p>
<p>What else am I into? Basketball for one, I love my Lakers and I love playing and thinking about basketball. I like sticking down low and posting up, but I’m not afraid to launch mid-range or the occasional long-range jumper.</p>
<p>Thing two out of my mouth when asked to describe myself is lifting weights. Somehow someway I got bit by the iron bug back in high school and I’ve lifted an average of four times a week ever since. I competed in a Power Lifting competition back in October and put up a 402lb squat, 264lb bench, and 501lb deadlift for a 1169lb total. At the time and in my federation (and age and weight class hah) I set records for the squat, bench, and powerlifting total. Then I promptly hurt my back in December and my records have been broken.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve dropped squatting and deadlifting because of my back (and benching because if I can’t deadlift who really cares), but luckily found I could front squat reasonably heavy recently lifting 275 for 3x3 (three sets, three reps). However I think 10 straight weeks of heavy weights has taken its toll and I’m backing off for a week or two. Maybe I’ll even see a doctor.</p>
<p>Okay I think I’ve blurted enough words onto this page that this post will stretch the screen all the way down.</p>

            Hi I'm Ben. I'm currently an intern at <a href="http://experts-exchange.com">Experts Exchange</a> and I'm graduating Cal Poly San Luis Obispo this Spring with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math. My main Computer Science interests include parallel and concurrent programming paradigms, machine learning, programming language theory (especially type theory and different programming paradigms), and functional programming. Outside of that I enjoy watching Sci-Fi TV, lifting weights, reading books, and playing basketball (go Lakers!). Enjoy whatever it is I write about.
