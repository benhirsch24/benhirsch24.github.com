      <p>So I’m lying here trying to sleep, my mind cranked up after a beautiful sunny day spent tucked away in the computer lab, and I’m realizing just how much coding I’m doing during this 11 week period that is my last quarter at school. I have an internship at <a href="http://e-e.com">Experts Exchange</a>, <a href="http://github.com/benhirsch24/dairy/">my senior project</a> trying to parallelize a genetic selection algorithm using CUDA, and <a href="http://github.com/benhirsch24/cinteractive">an interactive C visualizer</a> which is meant to help students learning C c how it executes. That’s a lot of coding, and each project calls for a different style and level of rigour in coding. My mind spun on this for a while and I realized I could totally write this down, so I am. Hopefully I can get to sleep afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="work-coding">Work Coding</h3>
<p>The web company I intern at uses Java. Originally I was grumbly because <em>grumble grumble</em> no higher order functions, lambdas, blah blah <em>grumble grumble</em> but I know deep down it’s the right choice for the job. For one, Java and their dependencies are obviously well supported and fairly to quite reliable. There’s documentation and the talent pool of developers is deep as Cal Poly is right there teaching its students Java primarily (with a bit of C and ML mixed in). Primarily.</p>
<p>Beyond the political/organizational there’s also just the pure code side. Java is a strongly, statically type language and obviously a huge part of the build and push process is compiling the code and making sure there are no errors. To go out there have to be no type errors and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard_correspondence#Origin.2C_scope.2C_and_consequences">which is proof a certain class of errors can’t occur</a>. Not all of course, there’s still the frustration of the dreaded NPE (Null Pointer Exception). Reflection can also subvert this too. But still, asking a computer program to verify your program can’t commit certain errors seems… smart. Logical. Why not do it? Honestly, if your product is software and you don’t want it to have bugs it seems like a statically typed language should be obvious.</p>
<p>Now that’s not to say Java is the best statically typed language. Of course there’s always Scala which is a Haskell/F# analogue of sorts that emits JVM bytecode (ie can interface with Java). But again, the talent pool for Java is wider and support comes easier rather than a relatively new and unpopular language.</p>
<p>It may not be my favorite work but it it’s still programming and above all problem solving. The objective and self-query is always “how do I work with what I have to get to my end goal?” Use the tools at your disposal, and choose the right tool for the job.</p>
<h3 id="cuda-izing-bayesc">CUDA-Izing BayesC</h3>
<p>I would describe my journey here as fun yet frustrating :). First of all the code base is written in frustratingly cramped C++. Everyone has their own code style but personally I enjoy lots of white space with just one, possibly two ideas per line. The code should speak, it should say “if this condition is met, then we do that. That means first you foo, then you bar, then you baz. If the condition was not met, figure out some more three letter cliche programming words to say because those are all I know.” Just to pile on of course I have no idea about this algorithm. I’ve got some basic statistics under my belt, I know about standard deviation and the different averages and such. But until I spent a solid weekend reading up on Markov Chains and watching different probabilistic graphical model lectures on coursera (luckily I signed up because it sounded cool, “Probabilistic Graphical Models”) and then pouring over the genetic portion again and again just to see which part corresponded to where in the code I was totally lost.</p>
<p>Then of course once the area for parallelization is identified (modulo some difficulties in implicit serialization) it’s time to get the data onto the GPU. But wait! It’s already using <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a> which is designed to vectorize and optimize while dropping rhymes like dimes linear algebra operations with vectors and matrices. The whole library is of course built around C++ templates to form an expression tree. Again, thank god I have Haskell experience and experience… thinking… about LISP macros haha. While I have built things with C++ before and am familiar with how its templates work, I can’t imagine how much less I would understand the compile-time expression tree is reduced into highly optimized code. Which can give super ambiguous errors, but still.</p>
<p>Anyways, I digress. Once I sussed out how to get the data out of Eigen, just to patch on this functionality it’s a lot of hacking. It’s as my CUDA code is this parasite, latched on to the back of this application turning genetic and phenotypic data into correlations and little plots. It’s feelers are latched in under the skin, right in the data stream just sucking up parameters and seeping out solSamples (whatever those are) and vectors of genotypic data right into the heart of the application. Gross. But after spending lots of time working on the application it’s rewarding to know exactly where to fiddle around so that my gross insect parasite of CUDA code can become a very beneficial symbiote. Not something you’d want as a pet, but you can admire its stick-to-it-iveness and agree that something that evolved that way could totally work out. That day when I fixed the errors I found using cuda-memcheck and getting it to run through all iterations of the markov chain with the kernel running through each marker; wow, I walked out of the computer lab on cloud 9.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-c-app-style">Interactive C App Style</h3>
<p>Probably the most fun coding I have right now though is my interactive C interpreter web application. It’s fun because</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It’s super creative and I get to figure out what I find important in intuitivizing a C program.</li>
<li>I like programming languages, compilers, and general state machine/automata like this, and I get a chance to build something with that knowledge.</li>
<li>Front-end work is fun! I make things appear and disappear, and occasionally slide.</li>
<li>I’m building something from the ground up. It started as nothing and I built it into something that people, students even, could actually use.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last point is the most important. This is the only application I completely own right now. Even though it is for the school, for the professor I’m working with, for the students who will use it to learn, it’s still completely original code on my part. I found a Haskell module (yay I got to use Haskell for a little bit) which could give me a C AST, learned and created a server using warp, and built a whole state machine compiler, stepper, and front end using Javascript. It’s validating and empowering when you can call all the shots and everything works.</p>
<p>There’s also a huge difference in how you code something from the ground up vs how you do it within the context of something greater than your piece. At work I have to think about their code style or how another component could interfere with mine, how to fit in with the underlying structure and conventions. With GenSel I’m more monkey-patching, throwing my code in as an option that could provide benefit and really getting close to the metal to get it work and work fast. Here, I’m starting from nothing and creating my own universe.</p>
<p>In creating this universe, some people may advocate total rigor from the beginning in structuring everything correctly with minimal dependencies and planned out the perfect algorithm. I just dove right in. Once I got the C AST generating in ghci (the Haskell REPL), I set about getting it to send to a web page. I went through several iterations of my Server; like when I wanted to serve a javascript file I had a separate function to open a handle to the file, convert it to a ByteString, then send it. I kept running into the problem where only some of my javascript files would send about halfway when I realized Warp uses Conduits, which I vaguely knew managed resources and of course Haskell is… interesting with its IO and resource management. As it turns out, the way I was doing it would only send 4096 bytes at a time. Luckily just as I was going to write something to circumvent this I found the <code>ResponseFile</code> data constructor and that was that.</p>
<p>Even though I read constantly about programming languages and how they work, different evaluation models and such I hadn’t actually built one completely on my own yet. It was always as part of a class or in case of my Core compiler following a tutorial/textbook with exercises. This was totally from scratch and I’m not afraid to say I was a bit intimidated at first. Eventually after reading around a bit on interpreters and just thinking about it I decided that I would follow the basic model of the Core compiler of a stepping function (and also <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/cesk-machines/">a couple posts on CESK interpreters</a>) I had a rough sketch of what to do and it was time to do it. It all boils down to just a problem to solve anyways. How do you make this programming language AST do stuff? Solve it, go.</p>
<p>However now that I have it at a stable place with loops, if/else statements, variables, function calls, and arrays working, I basically just got done separating it into modules using require.js, something I just learned because I knew it was a module system and I knew that my application had hit the critical point where it was necessary to break it up if I wanted to keep being productive. Now, would it have been better to structure it right away? I don’t really think so. Patterns and separation of logic occurred fairly organically as it built up; I didn’t throw everything together anyways, I broke things up as necessary and sometimes two things you thought were completely separate end up being completely dependent on each other while this third thing is essential in both those two anyways, might as well throw them all together… Patterns emerge as the system builds up. It’s so satisfying when the application gets to the point of the other two because you know this design was the one that made it.</p>
<p>That’s why even though the other two styles of programming and problem navigating are fun, this was my absolute favorite;</p>
