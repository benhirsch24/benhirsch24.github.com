    <title>Clever Initial Blog Post Title</title>
    <link>http://example.com/posts/2012-06-02-clever-initial-blog-post-title.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>So this is a blog about me. But what about me in particular? Well here’s a fact about me: I’m currently writing this entry to see what it’ll look like on my blog and to stretch out my blog a little bit.</p>
<p>You see, I consider myself a fantastic writer. I really do. I am able to BS with the best of em; I can churn out 5 pages in the blink of an eye. If words were my domain I would certainly not be surjective because the quantity of words I can combine and transform into a coherent sequence of thoughts is uncountably infinite.</p>
<p>Right now I just finished my Theory of Computation final, I’m considering what hosting to use for this blog (nothing over $10/month please, college kid here), and I’m waiting for a good time to make dinner. Carne asada and some left over turkey chili. It’s only 5 oclock right now so I’m not quite ready to eat yet.</p>
