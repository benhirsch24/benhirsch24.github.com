         <h2>Projects</h2>
<h3><a href="http://github.com/benhirsch24/cinteractive">Interactive C Interpreter</a></h3>
<p>This is a project I’m working on with <a href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~akeen">Aaron Keen</a>. The goal is to help 101 students understand how C executes more intuitively by providing an interactive interface to the program. Right now it feels like a less good debugger, but the interpreter is in a state to be easily extended and now I get to start thinking about different ways to provide information. Mostly written in Javascript with a small Haskell server which uses <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-c">the Language-C module</a> to parse and serve a C AST as JSON. Stay tuned…</p>
<h3><a href="http://github.com/benhirsch24/dairy">Parallel GenSel</a></h3>
<p>This is my senior project, so it’s still in progress. The goal of the project is to investigate using CUDA to parallelize <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/supplementary/1471-2105-12-186-s1.pdf">GenSel</a> which is a Genetic Selection program written in C++. Our target for parallelization is the BayesC algorithm (specified in <a href="http://www.gsejournal.org/content/pdf/1297-9686-36-3-261.pdf">this paper</a>) as it’s the currently most used algorithm.</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/benhirsch24/Core-Compiler">Core Compiler</a></h4>
<p>This isn’t really something I should leave up, but I will anyway. It was my first serious foray into Haskell programming and I think it’s totally broken. But it was super interesting at the time because I had written a Scheme interpreter in school and a compiler for SPARC, but I had no clue how a language like Haskell would be compiled especially with functions being curried. Now I know, and knowing is half the battle. Plus the compiling process with its state stepping function inspired me for the C interpreter, so evidently it did help in how I think about programming language execution models. It was fun to build a basic graph reduction machine with a couple types of basic garbage collection. When I get time I may try to re-write this with a type system and use my experience with Haskell more.</p>

            Hi I'm Ben. I'm currently an intern at <a href="http://experts-exchange.com">Experts Exchange</a> and I'm graduating Cal Poly San Luis Obispo this Spring with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math. My main Computer Science interests include parallel and concurrent programming paradigms, machine learning, programming language theory (especially type theory and different programming paradigms), and functional programming. Outside of that I enjoy watching Sci-Fi TV, lifting weights, reading books, and playing basketball (go Lakers!). Enjoy whatever it is I write about.
