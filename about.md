# About Me

Hi, I'm Ben.

As of May 2025 I'm a Principal Engineer at Amazon IVS and Twitch where I've worked since 2019. I focus on Amazon IVS's Low Latency HLS product. A couple of user-facing features I've shipped are [Timed Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/metadata.html) and [SRT Ingest](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-ivs-low-latency-streaming-srt-ingest/). Behind-the-scenes I've built the transcode capacity aggregation and job orchestration systems, and prototyped, productionized, and lead a multi-year migration from on-prem bare metal datacenters/network to AWS. Lately I've been getting more into how we manage our CDN and how to work with the AWS network to ensure our high-throughput video services continue to deliver great video quality to our customers.

In the past I've worked on [Amazon Cloud Cam](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Cloud-Indoor-Security-Camera/dp/B01MTOMIB4) (RIP) where I worked on our WebRTC SFU and computer vision pipeline. Before that I worked at [CENTR Cam](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/centr-cam-is-a-gopro-competitor-that-captures-everything-around-you/) (Also RIP) doing things like optimizing image processing kernels to dewarp fisheye cameras and blend them for [Movidius'](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/hardware/vision-accelerator-movidius-vpu.html) (RIP-ish?) "vector processing units" and generally trying to get things done for my first job out of college.

In college I was interested in GPU programming and programming language design. Still am.

I'd describe myself as a software engineer with solid knowledge in distributed systems, datacenters, and video, who knows how to acquire knowledge and get things done. One of my favorite compliments from a manager was "I don't have to worry when I put you on a project because I know you'll move it forward somehow".
