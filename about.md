# About Me

Hi, I'm Ben.

As of May 2025 I'm a Principal Engineer at Amazon IVS and Twitch where I've worked since 2019. I focus on Amazon IVS's Low Latency HLS product where I've done everything from ship features like [Timed Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/metadata.html) or [SRT](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-ivs-low-latency-streaming-srt-ingest/) to behind-the-scenes infrastructural changes like aggregating our origin datacenters' transcode capacities and exposing that to our global ingest dataplane or casually leading a multi-year effort to migrate from our managed bare metal datacenters/network to AWS. Lately I've been getting more into how we manage our CDN and how to work with the AWS network to ensure our high-throughput video services continue to deliver great video quality to our customers.

Basically networks are fun, make video good.

In the past I've worked on [Amazon Cloud Cam](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Cloud-Indoor-Security-Camera/dp/B01MTOMIB4) (RIP) where I worked on our WebRTC SFU and computer vision pipeline. Before that I worked at [CENTR Cam](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/centr-cam-is-a-gopro-competitor-that-captures-everything-around-you/) (Also RIP) doing things like optimizing image processing kernels to dewarp fisheye cameras and blend them for [Movidius'](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/hardware/vision-accelerator-movidius-vpu.html) (RIP-ish?) "vector processing units" and generally trying to get things done for my first job out of college.

In college I was interested in GPU programming and programming language design. Still am.

I'd describe myself as a software engineer who knows how to get things done and has ended up working on some very high-scale video systems, so I have a good knowledge base in video processing, distributed systems, and cloud datacenters. One of my favorite compliments from a manager was "I don't have to worry when I put you on a project because I know you'll move it forward somehow."
