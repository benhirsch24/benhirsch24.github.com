            <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ben.</p>
<p>Currently I'm a Principal Engineer at Amazon IVS and Twitch where I've worked since 2019. I focus on Amazon IVS's Low Latency HLS product where I've done everything from ship features like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyUserGuide/metadata.html">Timed Metadata</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/04/amazon-ivs-low-latency-streaming-srt-ingest/">SRT</a> to behind-the-scenes infrastructural changes like capturing our origin datacenters' transcode capacities and exposing that to our global ingest dataplane to make sure broadcasters will always have transcoding capacity. Lately I've been getting more into how we manage our CDN and how to work with the AWS network to ensure our high-throughput video services continue to deliver great video quality to our customers. Basically networks fun video good.</p>
<p>In the past I've worked on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Cloud-Indoor-Security-Camera/dp/B01MTOMIB4">Amazon Cloud Cam</a> (RIP) where I worked on our WebRTC SFU and computer vision pipeline. Before that I worked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/centr-cam-is-a-gopro-competitor-that-captures-everything-around-you/">CENTR Cam</a> (Also RIP) doing things like optimizing image processing kernels to dewarp fisheye cameras and blend them for <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/hardware/vision-accelerator-movidius-vpu.html">Movidius'</a> (RIP-ish?) "vector processing units" and generally trying to get things done for my first job out of college.</p>
<p>In college I was interested in GPU programming and programming language design. Still am.</p>
<p>I'd describe myself as a software engineer who knows how to get things done and has ended up working on some very high-scale video systems, so I have a good knowledge base in video processing, distributed systems, and (slowly growing) datacenter networks. One of my favorite compliments from a manager was "I don't have to worry when I put you on a project because I know you'll move it forward somehow."</p>
